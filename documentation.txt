for file formatting,
	each line in the text file is represented as a single instruction
	1st-3rd binary digit of line is considered as an operation
	4th-21st binary digit of line are the operands
	each operation is consisted of 6 binary digits
	1st binary digit for each operation represents whether the instruction is a register or an immediate value
	the succeeding binary digits after the classifier bit of an operand will be:
		- the decimal equivalent of the value if the classifier bit represents an immediate
		- the register n if the classifier bit represents a register
